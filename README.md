# My process
## Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
SCSS
CSSGrid
Media Queries
VsCode
Mobile-first workflow
What I learned
Used CSS grid property to properly apply structure to the page.
Applied color overlay over an image for the first time. [background-blend-mode: multiply]
This was my first project using SCSS. 
## Continued development
I have made it just mobile and desktop responsive. Need to work on more screen breakpoints in future projects.
Need to implement use of 'em' and 'rem'. I am used to 'px' which I know is considered bad practice for some properties.
Also need to develop habit of using proper tags in html markup. Avoid using heading tag unnecessarily when not required.
Learn HTML5 Accessibility habits.
